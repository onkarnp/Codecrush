Find the Book

Approach-
The problem is based on the concept of Arithmatic progression and Arithmatic sum. Tony has got three entities in the each testcase. d,t,total respectively.
He have to go in the library for 1 min at the starting and search for the required book. then he has to come back and again go in for 1+d minutes and the same sequence continuous.
while going in he has to take care that his time i.e. 1+(x)d should not cross the time limit (t). and one more thing given is total time required for searching the book. If the sum of the A.P. from time=1 to
 time<= t could reach or exceed total time ,Tony would manage to find the book.
i.e. in mathematical terms-
if,         {1 + (1+d) + (1+2d) + (1+3d).....(1+(x)d<=t)} >= total            //He will find the book otherwise NO

Solution Code-

#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
    long long int T;
    cin>>T;
    while(T--)
    {
        long long int t,d,total;
        long long int sum=0,i=0,y;
        cin>>d>>t>>total;
        while(1)
        {
          y=1+i*d;
          if(y<=t)
          {
              sum+=y;
              i++;
          }
          else
              break;
        }
        if(sum>=total)
            printf("Yes\n");
        else
            printf("No\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
